            <p class="text">Gaming chairs have grown popular among gamers over the past few years and if you're reading this, you likely want to find the perfect gaming chair for you. </p>
            <p class="text">Gaming chairs can offer excellent lower lumbar support which is great for your back and come packed with all of the ergonomics that you need in a chair. These chairs are not only made for gamers but are becoming a favourite for anyone that works and sits in front of your desk for long hours.</p>
            <p class="text">But when it’s time to choose your gaming chair, you'll realise how many options are out there making it more confusing to know which one is best for you. </p>
            <p class="text">So how do you choose the perfect gaming chair? </p>
            <p class="text">Don't worry, we’ve got your back. This guide will help you pick the best chair for your needs and you will learn what makes an excellent gaming chair, how to choose the best size, and a lot more. </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Adjustable Armrests</h2>
            <p class="text">Whether you’re gaming or working, remember that your arms need adequate support when sitting in your gaming chair. Plus, you also need to have the freedom to move and stay comfy. </p>
            <p class="text">If seated for hours, we suggest that you choose a gaming chair that sports 2D or 4D armrests. They should be designed to offer support to your forearms, elbows, and even your wrists.</p>
            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article//Beginners 101 - How to Choose the Perfect Gaming Chair/2.jpg">
            <p class="text">These armrests help optimise seating ergonomics while relieving any pressure along the shoulders and allow you to move the armrests up and down, front and back and in and out.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Backrest</h2>
            <p class="text">When testing the backrest of your gaming chair, you need to consider two things: adjustability and support. You can check by positioning the chair's pillows against the curve of your spine.</p>
            <p class="text">Play with the chair's recline until you find the perfect positioning. Your back will feel relaxed and comfortable because of the support it gives. </p>
            <p class="text">To check its adjustability, set the reclining position in different positions. You can angle it all the way back or position it upright. All these should be easy to shift and you should not have any problems doing so.</p>
            <p class="text">After making the adjustments, determine if you can stay in those positions for lengthy hours.</p>

            <h2>What is the Chair Made of?</h2>
            <p class="text">When choosing a chair, you shouldn’t just consider the comfort it gives. A key factor in determining if the chair is comfortable for you is the material that it is made out of. </p>
            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article//Beginners 101 - How to Choose the Perfect Gaming Chair/4.jpg">
            <p class="text">Here are a few common materials that are utilised when creating the ideal gaming chair.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>It’s All About Ergonomics</h2>
            <br>
            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article//Beginners 101 - How to Choose the Perfect Gaming Chair/7.jpg">
            <p class="text">Comfort is essential when choosing your perfect chair. That’s because cramping and aches while gaming isn’t something that would make for a great gaming experience.</p>
            <p class="text">This is where ergonomics steps in. It’s a design standard of making products that considers the psychology and physiology of a person.</p>
            <p class="text">For gaming chairs, it means creating these models to optimise the user’s comfort while retaining their physical wellness. This is the reason why a lot of gaming chairs sport different ergonomic elements.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why Is Ergonomics So Important?</h3>
            <p class="text">Ergonomics is critical to protecting your body against lasting pain and fatigue when using a computer for long hours. When it comes to gaming chairs, the most important thing that needs to be protected is your back and it does this by supporting your spine’s natural shape. </p>
            <p class="text">When your gaming chair integrates proper ergonomics, it will help stop slumping and slouching. Plus, it will lessen the stress on your pelvis, as well as your spine.</p>
            <p class="text">Posture and ergonomics are hugely related so you must remember this. Simply put, ergonomics builds a space that helps us consider the best posture.</p>
            <h3>Proper Height Adjustment</h3>
            <p class="text">The perfect gaming chair will let you properly adjust its height. This is important to give you better posture while comfortably viewing your monitor.</p>
            <p class="text">Having the right height for your seat will limit your neck movement. Instead of looking up or down for the whole duration of your gaming session, you'll want to look directly at your monitor. It will lessen the strain on your neck and shoulders while keeping your posture right.</p>
            <p class="text">Remember that the best viewing angle is between 20 to 50-degrees. With that, your chair should allow you to properly adjust its height that's perfect for the monitor.</p>
            <h3>Lumbar and Neck Support</h3>
            <p class="text">More pressure relief is made possible since some chairs have pillows and cushions. These come in the form of lumbar support and pillows. Specifically, they're pillows for the neck or the head</p>
            <p class="text">Lumbar support is important to prevent short-term and chronic pains. It stays against the small of your back to ensure the natural curve of the spine.</p>
            <p class="text">These need to be present when choosing your product since it offers outstanding circulation and stance. Thus, it will decrease the pressure on your spine.</p>
            <p class="text">For the pillows, these relieve tensions if you want to sit back and relax while gaming.</p>
