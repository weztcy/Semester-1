        <p class="text">Intel has launched the latest 12th-Gen processors ‘Alder Lake’, and everyone is curious about its performance. So, today we are going to show you the benchmark of the Alder Lake processors under daily tasks, content creation, and gaming.</p>
        <p class="text">We tested three models: the flagship i9-12900KF, the premium i7-12700KF, and the mid-level i5-12600K. The motherboard paired with the 12th-Gen processors is Z690 AORUS PRO, which is equipped with robust 16+1+2 phases of direct power and exclusive Fins Array II VRM thermal module.</p>

        <h2>Single- & Multi-Core Performance Test: Cinebench R23</h2>
        <p class="text">Let’s take a look at the single- and multi-core performance of 12th Gen under Cinebench R23. You can see that there’s about a 20% increase in the single-core performance compared with last gen. The spotlight is on the new i9 – with a whopping 2039 points of single-core performance, it tops all consumer processors. </p>

        <br>
        <p class="text">The multi-core performance of 12th Gen really shines, thanks to its newly added Efficiency Core, the so-called ‘small core.’ Compared with last gen, there’s at least a 50% performance boost, and you can expect a 77% boost on i9.</p>

        <h2>Video Encode/Decode Test</h2>
        <p class="text">Next is the video encode/decode test. We used x264 FHD benchmark for the test, and you can see the huge leap made by the 12th-Gen processors – they are up to 40% faster in comparison.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="text">We also tested the x265 to check how 12th Gen performs under newer video encode/decode methods. We see a similar performance improvement of at least 40% compared to 11th Gen.</p>

        <h2>The Game Tests</h2>
        <p class="text">Now, the moment you have been waiting for – the game tests. A quick note: Given the time constraints, we’ve only conducted the game tests with the i9-12900K. We will keep you posted on the i7 and i5 performance when they become available.</p>
        <p class="text">Compared with i9-11900K, you can expect at least 5% of FPS boost under each title. For the classic first-person-shooting game CS:GO, we saw something even more amazing: a 40% FPS increase! It means that even by upgrading to the 12th-Gen CPU, you could enjoy a performance boost equivalent to that of a GPU upgrade, which is really impressive.</p>

        <p class="text">Now let’s move on to something more extreme. The robust power & thermal design of AORUS Z690 motherboards can further push your 12th-Gen processor to the limit, and at this juncture, we're going to show you how much performance you will gain under CPU & memory overclocking. </p>
        <br><br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text">To wrap things up, the 12th-Gen processors shine not just in single- and multi-core performance benchmarks but are also able to provide promising real-world performance including daily tasking, content creation, and gaming. If you want to have the best performance out of your 12th-Gen processor, you need a solid foundation to build on. <br><br> The Z690 AORUS PRO we used for the test did just that with the robust 16+1+2 direct power design and cutting-edge Fins-Array II cooling technology for VRM. So if you’re looking for a board that could push your 12th-Gen processor to the limit, the AORUS Z690 motherboards are definitely your best choice. </p>
