            <p class="text">Well it’s that time of year again. Christmas trees are being decorated, letters are being swiftly delivered to Santa, and gamers around the world are impatiently waiting to hang their stockings to see what gaming goodies will be left on Christmas Eve night.</p>
            <p class="text">Santa’s Elves are working overtime to make sure that this year's Christmas goes off without a hitch and bring some Christmas cheer to those clacking away at their mechanical keyboards and trying to out-snipe their rivals in Call of Duty and Battlefield 2042.</p>
            <p class="text">But what are you doing for your fellow gaming brothers and sisters, new and old friends this Christmas? What do you get the gamer that possibly has everything?</p>
            <p class="text">Well, to help with this dilemma, our own helper elves have put together this Gamers Gift Guide to help take the worry out of what to gift your fellow gamer this year.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Gift Ideas Under $50</h2>
            <p class="text">To kick things off let’s take a look at what gifts you can get for gamers under the $50 price range.</p>
            <h3>GIGABYTE AORUS AMP500 Hybrid Gaming Mouse Pad</h3>
            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article/The Christmas 2021 PC Gamers Gift Guide//2021 Christmast Gift 3.jpg">
            <p class="text">Is their aim a little off? Are they over-aiming and missing crucial shots that they really should have made? Well, the GIGABYTE AORUS AMP500 Hybrid Gaming Mouse Pad may be the answer.</p>
            <p class="text">It's hybrid silicon base means that the mouse pad will stay exactly where it is, even during those rage-inducing gaming sessions and the added comfort that silicon offers means they can game longer.</p>
            <p class="text">The optimised textured surface of the mouse pad means that they will get the best precision out of their mouse movements possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Gift of Content Streaming</h3>
            <p class="text">A fantastic gift that you can give someone is a subscription for some content streaming services. When they want to take a break from gaming they can fire up the latest movie or TV show and zone out for a while.</p>
            <p class="text">For the movie and television fan, a Netflix subscription is the perfect choice. Offering thousands of movies and TV shows, Netflix really is the one stop shop for most things streaming. Add in the fact that you can stream a lot of content in 4K and you have the perfect thing to binge watch to.</p>
            <p class="text">Is your friend big into Anime? Do they often Naruto run everywhere because they think it makes them go faster? Well, Crunchyroll is THE go-to place to stream anime. Offering a mixture of subbed and dubbed content as well as simulcast streams, this is the perfect gift for anime lovers.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Gift Ideas Under $250</h2>
            <p class="text">We are now creeping up in the friend meter and looking at gifts that cost up to $250.</p>

            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article/The Christmas 2021 PC Gamers Gift Guide//2021 Christmast Gift 4.jpg">
            <p class="text">Does your friend still game on an old membrane keyboard, or do they have a keyboard that is filled with Cheeto dust and spilled Mountain Dew? Well, perhaps they would appreciate the gift of a new mechanical gaming keyboard?</p>
            <p class="text">The GIGABYTE AORUS K1 RGB Mechanical Keyboard offers stylish looks while rocking some Cherry MX switches. With full on-the-fly multimedia controls, the K1 puts everything at their fingertips.</p>
            <p class="text">Everything's better with RGB right? That’s why the AORUS K1 supports RGB Fusion 2.0, giving access to a whole heap of RGB lighting options, 16.7 million colours to be exact.</p>
            <p class="text">Onboard memory means that they can save all of their gaming presets to the keyboard itself and can create any macros that they use in games.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>GIGABYTE AORUS M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSD</h3>
            <img width="600px" src="../gallery/Article/The Christmas 2021 PC Gamers Gift Guide//2021 Christmast Gift 5.jpg">
            <p class="text">Slow boot speeds and loading times can be a real pain, especially as gamers just want to jump directly into the action. So why not give the gift of one of the fastest NVMe SSDs on the market today?</p>
            <p class="text">The GIGABYTE AORUS M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSD packs super fast PCIe Gen4 speeds in a tiny package. Providing speeds of up to 5,000 MB/s for sequential read and 2,500 MB/s for sequential write, this SSD is an absolute beast.</p>
            <p class="text">Coupled with a copper heatsink, the AORUS M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSD keeps cool, even whilst under load.</p>
            <p class="text">Gamers have the need, the need for speed, so give them the gift that gets them going, and going fast.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Nanoleaf Lighting</h3>
            <p class="text">A person's gaming space is their sanctuary. It is where they go to unwind and enjoy quality gaming time with friends. So why not help them make their gaming space a bit more personalised?</p>
            <p class="text">The Nanoleaf lighting options are a great way for gamers to be able to express their personality and really make their space their own. By attaching the Nanoleaf modular panels to their gaming space, gamers are able to set a wide range of RGB lighting options to really set the mood.</p>
